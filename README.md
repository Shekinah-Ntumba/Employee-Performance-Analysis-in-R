# üìà Employee Performance Analysis with R

This project focuses on exploring and visualizing key patterns in employee performance using **R programming**. It aims to uncover how factors such as **age, experience, salary, gender, and department** influence performance outcomes within an organization. By combining statistical insights with graphical analysis, the project provides a comprehensive overview of workforce productivity and engagement.

## üß† Project Overview

The objective of this project was to analyze the performance data of employees and identify trends that could guide **human resource management decisions**.

The dataset included variables such as:

* Employee demographics ‚Äî *Age, Gender, and Department*
* Work-related data ‚Äî *Salary, Experience, and Performance Score*
* Employment details ‚Äî *Joining Date, Status, and Location*

Through data cleaning and visualization, the project highlighted how different departments perform, how gender and experience relate to performance, and which factors show strong correlations with employee success.

## üß∞ Tools & Libraries Used

* **R Programming Language:** Used for statistical analysis and data visualization.
* **tidyverse:** A collection of R packages for data cleaning, transformation, and plotting.
* **ggplot2:** For creating clear and detailed visualizations such as histograms, boxplots, and line charts.
* **corrplot:** For generating correlation heatmaps to understand relationships between numerical variables.
* **lubridate:** To handle date formats and analyze trends over time.

## üìä Key Analyses & Visualizations

### **1. Employee Performance Distribution**

A histogram was used to show how employee performance scores are distributed across the company. This helped reveal whether most employees were performing at average levels or if there were noticeable peaks in low or high performance categories.

### **2. Performance by Department**

A boxplot compared employee performance across departments such as HR, IT, and Sales. This visualization identified which departments had the highest average performance and where improvement efforts might be needed.

### **3. Performance Trends Over Time**

By examining performance scores alongside employees‚Äô joining dates, a trend analysis showed how performance has changed over time. This helped determine if newer hires were performing better or worse compared to long-term employees.

### **4. Correlation Analysis**

A correlation matrix was used to explore how numerical factors ‚Äî such as salary, age, experience, and performance score ‚Äî are related. The correlation heatmap provided insights into which variables have the strongest influence on performance outcomes.

### **5. Average Performance by Gender**

A bar chart visualized the average performance scores for each gender. This allowed for the assessment of potential gender-based performance disparities and supported the organization‚Äôs diversity and inclusion analysis.

## üí° Insights & Findings

**Findings:**

* Performance scores differ across departments, with certain teams consistently outperforming others.
* Salary and experience show a moderate positive correlation with performance ‚Äî indicating that more experienced employees tend to perform better.
* Gender differences in performance were minimal, suggesting an equitable work environment.
* Performance trends over time indicate varying productivity levels depending on the period of hiring or training.

**Recommendations:**

* Focus on departments with lower median performance scores by offering mentorship or skill development programs.
* Use correlation insights to align salary growth with performance and experience.
* Maintain diversity and inclusion initiatives, as performance outcomes appear balanced across genders.
* Regularly monitor performance trends to identify early signs of employee disengagement.

## üìà Outcome

This analysis provides HR managers and organizational leaders with a deeper understanding of employee performance patterns. It enables data-driven decision-making in:

* Identifying high-performing departments and individuals
* Detecting areas requiring training or policy changes
* Monitoring fairness and balance in performance outcomes across demographics

Overall, this project demonstrates how **R-based analytics** can transform raw HR data into actionable insights that improve workforce management and organizational performance.
